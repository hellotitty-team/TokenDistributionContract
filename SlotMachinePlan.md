I'll help you create a plan for a slot machine contract in Solidity without using Chainlink. Let me first explore your codebase to understand the current structure and then outline a comprehensive plan.

Great! I can see you have a Hardhat project set up with OpenZeppelin contracts and an empty `SlotMachine.sol` file. Let me create a comprehensive plan for building a slot machine contract without Chainlink.

## ðŸŽ° Slot Machine Contract Plan

### **Core Components Overview**

Since we can't use Chainlink VRF, we'll need to implement alternative randomness strategies. Here's our comprehensive plan:

### **1. Randomness Strategy (Without Chainlink)**

**Option A: Commit-Reveal Scheme (Recommended)**
- Players commit to a bet with a hashed secret
- After commitment window, they reveal the secret
- Most secure option but requires two transactions

**Option B: Block-based Randomness (Simpler)**
- Use `blockhash`, `block.timestamp`, and `block.difficulty`
- Combine with player address and nonce for additional entropy
- Less secure but single transaction

**Option C: Hybrid Approach**
- Combine multiple entropy sources
- Add player-provided randomness
- Balance security and UX

### **2. Contract Architecture**

```
SlotMachine.sol (Main contract)
â”œâ”€â”€ ISlotMachine.sol (Interface)
â”œâ”€â”€ SlotMachineStorage.sol (Storage layout)
â”œâ”€â”€ SlotMachineEvents.sol (Events)
â””â”€â”€ Libraries/
    â”œâ”€â”€ RandomnessLib.sol (Randomness generation)
    â”œâ”€â”€ PayoutLib.sol (Win calculation)
    â””â”€â”€ ReelLib.sol (Reel symbols and logic)
```

### **3. Game Mechanics**

**Reel Configuration:**
- 3x3 or 5x3 slot machine
- 8-12 different symbols per reel
- Weighted probability distribution
- Multiple paylines

**Symbols & Payouts:**
- Cherry, Lemon, Orange, Grape, Bell, Bar, Seven, Jackpot
- Different payout multipliers (1x to 1000x)
- Progressive jackpot possibility

### **4. Core Features**

**Essential Features:**
- âœ… Betting system with min/max limits
- âœ… Multiple paylines (1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 20)
- âœ… House edge (2-5% configurable)
- âœ… Win calculation and automatic payout
- âœ… Emergency pause functionality
- âœ… Owner withdrawal of house funds

**Advanced Features:**
- ðŸŽ¯ Progressive jackpot
- ðŸŽ¯ Bonus rounds
- ðŸŽ¯ Free spins
- ðŸŽ¯ Player statistics tracking
- ðŸŽ¯ VIP tiers with better odds

### **5. Security Considerations**

**Critical Security Measures:**
- âœ… Reentrancy protection (OpenZeppelin ReentrancyGuard)
- âœ… Access control (Owner/Operator roles)
- âœ… Input validation and overflow protection
- âœ… Proper randomness entropy mixing
- âœ… Maximum bet limits to prevent drain attacks
- âœ… Circuit breakers for unusual activity

### **6. Implementation Steps**

**Phase 1: Basic Structure**
1. Set up contract interfaces and events
2. Implement basic randomness generation
3. Create simple 3x3 slot with basic symbols
4. Add betting and basic win detection

**Phase 2: Game Logic**
1. Implement multiple paylines
2. Add symbol weights and probabilities
3. Create payout calculation system
4. Add house edge mechanics

**Phase 3: Advanced Features**
1. Progressive jackpot system
2. Bonus features and free spins
3. Player statistics and history
4. Gas optimization

**Phase 4: Security & Testing**
1. Comprehensive security review
2. Edge case testing
3. Gas optimization
4. Frontend integration preparation

### **7. Randomness Implementation Details**

**For Commit-Reveal Approach:**
```solidity
struct Commitment {
    bytes32 commitment;
    uint256 betAmount;
    uint256 paylines;
    uint256 blockNumber;
    bool revealed;
}

mapping(address => Commitment) public commitments;
```

**For Block-based Approach:**
```solidity
function generateRandomness(address player, uint256 nonce) internal view returns (uint256) {
    return uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(
        blockhash(block.number - 1),
        block.timestamp,
        block.difficulty,
        player,
        nonce
    )));
}
```

### **8. Gas Optimization Strategy**

- Pack struct variables efficiently
- Use events for non-critical data storage
- Optimize loop operations for payline calculations
- Consider L2 deployment for lower costs
- Implement batch operations where possible

### **9. Testing Strategy**

- Unit tests for randomness distribution
- Integration tests for complete game flows
- Fuzzing for edge cases
- Statistical analysis of payouts
- Front-running protection tests

Would you like me to start implementing any specific part of this plan? I'd recommend beginning with the basic contract structure and simple randomness generation, then building up the game mechanics progressively.

What randomness approach would you prefer to start with - the commit-reveal scheme (more secure) or the block-based approach (simpler)?
