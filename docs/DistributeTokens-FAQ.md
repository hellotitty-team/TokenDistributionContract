# DistributeTokens Contract: Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is the DistributeTokens contract?

The DistributeTokens contract is a smart contract that automatically distributes any tokens it receives among predetermined wallet addresses according to fixed percentages. Think of it as an automatic sorting machine that divides tokens based on rules that cannot be changed.

### Why was this contract created?

This contract was created to ensure fair, transparent, and tamper-proof distribution of tokens. By automating the distribution process and making it unchangeable, it eliminates the possibility of manipulation and builds trust among all participants.

### How does the contract work?

The contract works in three simple steps:
1. Tokens are sent to the contract address
2. Someone triggers the distribution function
3. The contract automatically calculates how many tokens each wallet should receive based on their percentage and sends the tokens accordingly

### Who can use this contract?

Anyone can use this contract to distribute tokens. The distribution process is public and can be triggered by anyone - there are no special permissions needed to start a distribution.

## Distribution Questions

### What are the distribution percentages?

The distribution percentages are fixed as follows:
- Marketing wallet: 30%
- Charity for Breast Cancer: 20%
- Team & Advisors: 20%
- Community wallet: 10%
- Developer wallet: 10%
- Burn address (tokens permanently removed from circulation): 10%

### Can the distribution percentages be changed?

No. The distribution percentages are permanently fixed when the contract is deployed. They cannot be changed afterward by anyone, not even the creator of the contract.

### How often are tokens distributed?

Tokens are not distributed automatically on a schedule. Distribution happens when someone triggers the `distributeTokens` function. This can be done at any time, but only if there are tokens in the contract to distribute.

### What happens if someone sends a very small amount of tokens to the contract?

The contract will still distribute the tokens according to the percentages. For very small amounts, some recipients might receive 0 tokens due to rounding (since tokens can't be divided into fractions). Any tiny remainders stay in the contract until the next distribution.

## Technical Questions

### What types of tokens can be distributed?

The contract can distribute any standard ERC20 token. This includes most common tokens on Ethereum and compatible blockchains.

### Is there a fee for using the contract?

The contract itself doesn't charge any fee for distributing tokens. However, triggering the distribution function requires paying for gas (transaction fees) on the blockchain.

### How do I know the distribution happened correctly?

Every distribution is recorded on the blockchain through events (also called logs). You can verify exactly how many tokens were distributed and to which wallets. Additionally, the contract keeps an internal record of all distributions that anyone can check.

### What happens if the contract receives non-ERC20 tokens or ETH?

The contract is designed to handle ERC20 tokens only. If ETH or non-standard tokens are sent to the contract, they might become stuck as the contract doesn't have functions to distribute them.

## Security Questions

### Has the contract been audited?

Yes, the contract has undergone comprehensive security audits, including:
- Professional audit by a respected security firm
- Automated scanning using specialized security tools
- Multiple independent code reviews by experienced developers

### Can someone steal tokens from the contract?

No. The contract has no functions that allow manual withdrawal of tokens. Tokens can only leave the contract through the automatic distribution process, which sends tokens to the predetermined wallets according to the fixed percentages.

### What happens if there's a bug in the contract?

The contract has been thoroughly tested and audited to minimize the possibility of bugs. However, like all software, smart contracts can have unforeseen issues. That said, the contract's simplicity and lack of complex features significantly reduce the risk of serious bugs.

### Is the code open source?

Yes, the contract's source code is publicly available and verified on block explorers like Etherscan. Anyone can review the code to understand exactly how it works.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Distributing a specific token

If you want to distribute a specific token that the contract has received:

1. Find the token's contract address (e.g., 0x1234...5678)
2. Call the `distributeTokens` function with that address
3. The contract will distribute all of that token type according to the percentages

### Example 2: Checking how much has been distributed

If you want to see how many tokens have been distributed to a specific wallet:

1. Find the token's contract address (e.g., 0x1234...5678)
2. Find the recipient wallet address (e.g., 0xABCD...EF01)
3. Call the `getDistributedAmount` function with both addresses
4. The function will return the total amount distributed to that wallet

### Example 3: Viewing all allocation percentages

If you want to see all the wallet addresses and their percentages:

1. Call the `getAllocations` function
2. The function will return the complete list of allocations, including each wallet address and its percentage

## Additional Questions

### What if I accidentally send tokens to the contract?

If you send ERC20 tokens to the contract, they will be distributed according to the fixed percentages when someone triggers the distribution function. This is the intended behavior of the contract.

### Can I use this contract for my own project?

The contract code is open source and can be used as a reference or template for your own projects. However, if you deploy this contract, remember that the allocation percentages and wallet addresses will be permanently fixed, so ensure they are correct before deployment.
