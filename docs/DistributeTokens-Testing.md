# DistributeTokens Contract: Testing Documentation

## Testing Philosophy

The DistributeTokens contract has been extensively tested to ensure it functions correctly, securely, and as expected in all scenarios. Our testing approach follows industry best practices for smart contract development:

1. **Complete Test Coverage**: We aim for 100% code coverage to ensure every line of code, every function, and every possible execution path is tested.

2. **Multiple Test Types**: We use a combination of unit tests, integration tests, and scenario-based tests to validate the contract from different perspectives.

3. **Edge Case Testing**: We specifically test edge cases and potential failure modes to ensure the contract behaves correctly even in unexpected situations.

## Test Suite Overview

Our test suite consists of the following categories of tests:

### 1. Deployment Tests

These tests verify that the contract deploys correctly:

- Verify that allocations are set up correctly during deployment
- Confirm that the percentages add up to exactly 100%
- Test that deployment fails if percentages don't add up to 100%

### 2. Distribution Functionality Tests

These tests verify the core token distribution functionality:

- Verify tokens are distributed according to the correct percentages
- Confirm that distribution tracking is updated correctly
- Test distribution of multiple different token types
- Verify correct handling of zero balance situations

### 3. Event Emission Tests

These tests verify that events are emitted correctly:

- Confirm `TokensDistributed` events are emitted with correct parameters
- Verify `AllocationDistributed` events are emitted for each allocation
- Test event parameters match the actual distribution amounts

### 4. Error Handling Tests

These tests verify that the contract handles errors appropriately:

- Test behavior when trying to distribute a zero address token
- Verify errors when trying to distribute with no tokens in the contract
- Test error messages match the expected custom errors

### 5. View Function Tests

These tests verify the view functions work correctly:

- Confirm `getAllocations()` returns the correct allocation array
- Verify `getDistributedAmount()` returns the correct distribution amounts
- Test view functions with various input parameters

## Test Scenarios

Our tests include the following key scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Basic Distribution

Test a simple distribution of tokens with a typical amount (e.g., 1,000 tokens) and verify:
- Each wallet receives the correct amount
- Distribution records are updated properly
- Events are emitted correctly

### Scenario 2: Multiple Token Types

Test distribution of multiple different token types to ensure:
- Each token type is tracked separately
- Distribution percentages apply consistently across token types
- History is maintained correctly per token type

### Scenario 3: Unusual Amounts

Test distribution of unusual token amounts, including:
- Very small amounts (e.g., 1 token)
- Very large amounts (e.g., maximum uint256 value / 10)
- Amounts that don't divide evenly by the percentages
- Verify rounding behavior and that no tokens are lost

### Scenario 4: Multiple Distributions

Test multiple sequential distributions to ensure:
- History accumulates correctly
- Repeated distributions work as expected
- No state corruption occurs after many distributions

## Code Coverage

Our test suite achieves comprehensive code coverage across the contract:

| Category           | Coverage |
|--------------------|----------|
| Functions          | 100%     |
| Statements         | 100%     |
| Branches           | 100%     |
| Lines              | 100%     |

### Coverage Details by Function

| Function                 | Statement Coverage | Branch Coverage |
|--------------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| constructor()            | 100%              | 100%           |
| distributeTokens()       | 100%              | 100%           |
| getAllocations()         | 100%              | N/A            |
| getDistributedAmount()   | 100%              | N/A            |

## Running the Tests

To run the tests yourself, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the test suite:
   ```
   npx hardhat test
   ```
4. Generate a coverage report:
   ```
   npx hardhat coverage
   ```

## Testing Tools

Our test suite uses the following tools and frameworks:

1. **Hardhat**: Our development environment for compilation, testing, and deployment
2. **Ethers.js**: For interacting with the Ethereum contracts during tests
3. **Chai**: For assertions and test structure
4. **Solidity Coverage**: For generating code coverage reports
5. **Hardhat Network**: For simulating an Ethereum network during testing

## Continuous Integration

We employ continuous integration to ensure all tests pass for every change:

1. Tests run automatically on every pull request
2. Code coverage reports are generated and reviewed
3. Failed tests block merging of changes
4. Security scanning tools run alongside tests to identify potential vulnerabilities

## Security Audits

In addition to our test suite, the DistributeTokens contract has undergone:

1. Multiple independent code reviews
2. Automated security scanning using tools like Slither, Mythril, and Echidna
3. Professional security audit by a respected audit firm

The combination of comprehensive testing and external security reviews ensures the contract functions correctly and securely.
