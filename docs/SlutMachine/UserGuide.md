## Understanding How Winning Works

### The Game Board

SlutMachine has a 3×3 grid of symbols, like this:

```
[Symbol] [Symbol] [Symbol]
[Symbol] [Symbol] [Symbol]
[Symbol] [Symbol] [Symbol]
```

### Winning Lines

You win when you get matching symbols in any of these lines:
- 3 horizontal rows
- 3 vertical columns
- 2 diagonal lines (corner to corner)

That means there are 8 possible ways to win on each spin!

### Symbol Values

Different symbols have different values:

1. **Cherry** - Most common, pays 1.1× your bet
2. **Lemon** - Common, pays 1.2× your bet
3. **Orange** - Less common, pays 2.5× your bet
4. **Grape** - Uncommon, pays 5× your bet
5. **Bell** - Rare, pays 10× your bet
6. **Seven** - Very rare, pays 50× your bet

*ELI5*: Just like in real slot machines, some symbols are worth more than others. The harder it is to get, the more it pays!

### Multiple Wins

If you get multiple winning lines in a single spin, you win for EACH line!

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple Win

Let's say you bet 10 tokens and get this result:

```
Cherry Cherry Cherry
Bell   Grape  Lemon
Orange Seven  Bell
```

You have one winning line – the top row with 3 Cherries.
- Cherry pays 1.1× your bet
- 10 tokens × 1.1 = 11 tokens
- After 5% house edge: 11 × 0.95 = 10.45 tokens
- You get back 10.45 tokens as winnings

### Example 2: Multiple Wins

Let's say you bet 10 tokens and get this lucky result:

```
Cherry Cherry Cherry
Grape  Grape  Grape
Lemon  Bell   Seven
```

You have two winning lines:
- Top row: 3 Cherries = 1.1× your bet = 11 tokens
- Middle row: 3 Grapes = 5× your bet = 50 tokens
- Total raw winnings: 61 tokens
- After 5% house edge: 61 × 0.95 = 57.95 tokens
- You get back 57.95 tokens as winnings

### Example 3: Big Jackpot

Let's say you bet 50 tokens and get an amazing result:

```
Seven Seven Seven
Bell  Seven Bell
Lemon Grape Seven
```

You have one winning line with the top row of 3 Sevens:
- Seven pays 50× your bet
- 50 tokens × 50 = 2,500 tokens
- After 5% house edge: 2,500 × 0.95 = 2,375 tokens
- You get back 2,375 tokens as winnings!

## Tracking Your Play

SlutMachine keeps track of:
- All your past spins
- How much you've bet in total
- How much you've won in total
- Your total number of spins

You can view this history anytime through the interface.

*ELI5*: It's like having a record book that remembers every time you played and whether you won or lost.

## Tips for New Players

1. **Start Small**: Begin with smaller bets to get familiar with the game.

2. **Set Limits**: Decide how much you're willing to spend before you start.

3. **Understanding Randomness**: Each spin is completely random, regardless of your previous spins.

4. **Check Parameters**: You can see the game's minimum/maximum bet and house edge percentage directly in the interface.

5. **Verify Transactions**: If you're curious, you can see all your bets and wins on a blockchain explorer.

## Troubleshooting

### "Insufficient Allowance" Error

This means you haven't approved the game to use your tokens yet. Go back to Step 3 and approve token usage.

### "Invalid Bet Amount" Error

Your bet is either below the minimum or above the maximum allowed bet. Adjust your bet amount.

### "Insufficient Balance" Error

You don't have enough tokens to make the bet. Add more tokens to your wallet.

### "User Seed Required" Error

You forgot to enter a random seed. Add any random text in the seed field.

## Enjoy Responsibly

Remember that SlutMachine, like all gambling games, should be played for entertainment only. Set a budget for yourself and stick to it. The house always has a slight edge, so play for fun, not as an investment strategy.
