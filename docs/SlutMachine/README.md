# SlutMachine: A Digital Slot Machine Experience

## What is SlutMachine?

SlutMachine is a digital slot machine that runs on blockchain technology. Think of it as a virtual 3x3 slot machine you might find in a casino, but powered by smart contracts that ensure fairness, transparency, and security. The game uses digital tokens for placing bets and receiving winnings.

## How It Works (For Everyone)

### The Basics

1. **The Game Board**: SlutMachine features a classic 3x3 grid (3 rows and 3 columns) of symbols, just like traditional slot machines.

2. **Symbols**: The game includes 6 different symbols with varying probabilities and payout rates:
   - Cherry (most common, lowest payout)
   - Lemon
   - Orange
   - Grape
   - Bell
   - Seven (rarest, highest payout)

3. **Placing Bets**: Players bet with digital tokens. There's a minimum bet amount to play and a maximum bet limit.

4. **Spinning**: When you spin, the machine randomly selects symbols for each position on the 3x3 grid.

5. **Winning**: You win when you get matching symbols in a line. There are 8 possible winning lines:
   - 3 horizontal lines (rows)
   - 3 vertical lines (columns) 
   - 2 diagonal lines

6. **Multiple Wins**: If you get multiple winning lines in a single spin, you receive payouts for each line!

7. **House Edge**: Like all casino games, there's a small house edge (typically around 5%) that ensures the game operator can maintain the service while still providing fair payouts.

## Example: How a Spin Works

Let's imagine a simple example:

1. You bet 10 tokens.
2. You spin and get this result:
   ```
   Cherry Cherry Cherry
   Lemon  Bell   Grape
   Orange Orange Orange
   ```

3. You have two winning lines:
   - Top row: 3 Cherries in a row
   - Bottom row: 3 Oranges in a row

4. The Cherry pays 1.1x your bet amount for that line, and the Orange pays 2.5x.

5. Your winnings are:
   - Cherry line: 10 tokens × 1.1 = 11 tokens
   - Orange line: 10 tokens × 2.5 = 25 tokens
   - Total: 36 tokens

6. After the house edge of 5% is applied: 36 × 0.95 = 34.2 tokens

7. You receive 34.2 tokens as winnings (plus you keep your original 10 token bet).
